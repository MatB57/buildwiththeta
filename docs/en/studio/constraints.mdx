# UI Alignment Constraints

The UI Alignment Constraints allow you to control the positioning of an element within a layout. You can set alignment options for both the vertical and horizontal axes. The three options available are `start`, `end`, and `stretch`.

## Horizontal Alignment

* `Start`: Aligns the element to the left of the container. The element will be positioned according to the left value.

* `End`: Aligns the element to the right of the container. The element's right edge will be positioned according to the left value.

* `Stretch`: Stretches the element horizontally to fill the width of the container, maintaining the left and right border values.

## Vertical Alignment

* `Start`: Aligns the element to the top of the container. The element will be positioned according to the top value.

* `End`: Aligns the element to the bottom of the container. The element's bottom edge will be positioned according to the top value.

* `Stretch`: Stretches the element vertically to fill the height of the container, maintaining the top and bottom border values.

## Examples

1. If you select `start` for both vertical and horizontal alignment, the element will be positioned at the top-left corner, with the top and left values determining the exact position.

2. If you select `end` for both vertical and horizontal alignment, the element will be positioned at the bottom-right corner, with the top and left values determining the exact position.

3. If you select `stretch` for horizontal alignment, the element will span the full width of the screen, with its width determined by the left and right border values.
