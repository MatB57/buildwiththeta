# Theta Docs

Theta Docs uses [docs.page](https://docs.page).

## How to contribute

Before contributing, read [Contributing]() and [Code of Conduct]().
To edit our docs, update a file in the /docs folder. Any update will be automatically posted to readable web docs as well.

## Types of docs

We organize docs in 4 types:

1. Guides: teach developers how to use a product. "I have XX problem, how do I solve it?"
2. Tutorials: walk-throughs, have a large outcome. "Build a web application with Theta".
3. Explanations: teach developers about a broad topic. "What is a sideloading?"
4. Reference: technical descriptions of tools and how to use them. "What errors does the API return?"
