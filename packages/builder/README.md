# [Theta](https://buildwiththeta.com): prototyping and testing in production

Prototype and test dynamic user interfaces with instant fly-on-air updates. You can update the user interface without rebuilding it. You can directly set up remote A/B tests and see the analysis to improve UX and sales.


- Documentation: https://docs.buildwiththeta.com

You can run UI/UX tests in your app with Theta on the following platforms:

- **iOS**
- **Android**
- **Web**
- **VisionOS**
- **macOS**
- **Windows**

## Why Theta?

Building a Flutter app means you will take little time to program it from scratch, but you will spend almost all your time updating and testing it to improve UX and sales.

But testing and updating even small parts of our app's UI (e.g., paywalls, news dialogs, or even text copy) is a mechanism that requires putting hands on code and wasting a lot of time with each change. 

This is crazy, which is why I created a tool to update and test apps in production with a few clicks.

### Developers shouldn't hardcode UI components

Server-driven design systems focus on creating dynamic user interfaces (UIs) that can be updated instantly without building. Instead of hardcoding design components into the app, they are stored remotely. This allows central updates that are propagated instantly across all instances of the app, without the need for user downloads.

Theta offers several advantages:
- **‚ö°Ô∏è Integrate tonight**: Theta provides a UI editor for designing the UI that can be integrate directly into your project with SDKs. Theta doesn‚Äôt limit what you can do with the rest of your app. You can embed complex platform-specific widgets like maps, web views, media players, and camera feeds within your remote UI, or add a UIBox() inside an existing custom page to make it dynamic.
- **üîÄ Set tests remotely with instant effects**: Set up numerous A/B tests on your UI components to improve the user experience and sales of your app. Everything can be done visually on Theta, with a direct connection (and effect) to your customers' apps without wasting time.
- **üßã Team collaboration and version control:** Theta provides tools for team collaboration, project logs, and branches, facilitating efficient teamwork in app development. The version control feature allows tracking and management of different versions of the your design system components, a crucial aspect for maintaining app quality and addressing bugs or issues.
- **üí´ Efficiency:** Server-driven UI allow for design updates to be rolled out instantly via API, across all instances of the app. This bypasses the traditional cycle of updating and downloading new app versions. Also, because the design system is centralized, it ensures a consistent look and feel across all platforms, enhancing the user experience.

### Initialize Theta

1. Initialize Theta by calling `Theta.initialize` with your anonymous key.
2. Wrap your app with `ThetaProvider` to enable any UIBox to receive the theme and project styles.

```dart
import 'package:theta/theta.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
    await Theta.initialize(anonKey: 'thetaKey');
    
    runApp(
        ThetaProvider(
            theme: ThemeMode.light,
            child: MaterialApp(
                home: // ...
            ),
        )
    );
}
```

### Display components

Everything you need to do is to add a `UIBox` widget to your app and pass the component name as a parameter.


Use `branch` to specify the branch of the component to render. If not specified, the default branch will be used.

> This is useful for testing new features without affecting the production environment or for versioning the component.

```dart
return Scaffold(
    body: Center(
        child: UIBox(
            'Component name', 
            branch: '1.0.0',
        ),
    ),
);
```

### Loading placeholder and error handling

You can display a placeholder widget during loading and an error widget.

```dart
UIBox(
    'Homepage',
    placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(),
    errorWidget: (error) => Text(error.toString()),
)
```

### Use a controller

Use a controller for greater control of the remote component.

```dart
final controller = UIBoxController();

controller.onLoaded(() {
    debugPrint('Loaded!');
    debugPrint('Component ID: ${controller.componentID}');
    debugPrint('Nodes: ${controller.nodesToList()}');
});
controller.onError((error) => debugPrint(error.toString()));

UIBox(
    'Feed',
    controller: controller,
);

controller.dispose();
```

## Interoperability with your code

Want a dynamic UI with gesture support (onTap, doubleTap, etc.)? You can add functions, called `workflows`, based on gesture triggers.

```dart
UIBox(
    'AppBar',
    workflows: [
        Workflow('Container s4l3s', Trigger.onTap, () {
            // Do something
        }),
    ],
)
```


### Overrides

- Documentation: [https://docs.buildwiththeta.com/en/builder/overrides](https://docs.buildwiththeta.com/en/builder/overrides)

You can override each UI block with a Flutter widget by mixing no-code with Flutter. 

```dart
UIBox(
    'Social card',
    overrides: [
        // Override a node with a Flutter widget
        Override(
            'Button',
            builder: (context, node, child, children) {
                return GestureDetector(
                    onTap: () {
                        debugPrint('Tapped!');
                    },
                    child: Container(
                        color: Colors.black,
                        child: child, // You can even use the original child 
                    ),
                );
            },
        ),

        // Override a node of a component with a custom text and color
        Override(
            'Post title',
            component: 'Component id',
            text: 'My beautiful cat',
            color: Colors.white,
        ),

        // Override a node of a component with a custom image
        Override('Cover')
            ..setImage('https://...'),
    ],
),
```

### Child override

If in the no-code component the element to which you want to overwrite the child already has one, 
it will be removed and replaced with the one entered by the user via code.

You can also use the `UIBox` within other `UIBox`es. This provides a very high degree of customization.

```dart
UIBox(
    'Component name',
    overrides: [
        // Override the child of an element
        Override('Element id')
            ..setChild(UIBox('Other component')),
    ],
),
```

### Children override

You can also overwrite the children of an element. 

```dart
UIBox(
    'Component name',
    overrides: [
        // Override the children of an element
        Override('Element name')
            ..setChildren([
                Text('Child 1'), 
                Text('Child 2')
            ]),
    ],
),
```
